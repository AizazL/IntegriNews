IntegriNews AI is a Fake News Classifier app with extra features, utilizing a custom built tensor model trained on the WELFake dataset with a 98%+ accuracy.

.exe can be run from dist/IntregiNews (you'll need the _internal folder which contains all the necessary libraries as well), or you can run the main.py if you have the correct Python version installed alongside all the libraries.

- You can export all classification results from your current session into a csv with a click of a button. 
- You can toggle dark mode on or off with the checkbox at the top right at any time.
- You can view the live pie chart which updates to reflect the classification ratio for the current session.
